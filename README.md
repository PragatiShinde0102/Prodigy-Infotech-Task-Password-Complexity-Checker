# üîê Password Complexity Checker

This project is a Python-based GUI tool that evaluates the strength of a password in real time.  
It is designed to highlight the importance of strong password practices in cybersecurity and demonstrates how regular expressions and GUI design can be combined for practical security applications.

## ‚ú® Key Highlights
- **Real-Time Validation**: Provides instant feedback as the user types.
- **Multiple Criteria Checks**:
  - Minimum length (8 characters)
  - At least one digit
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one special character
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Tkinter for a clean and interactive design.
- **Actionable Feedback**: Clearly displays missing requirements and strength level (Weak, Medium, Strong).

## üöÄ Purpose of the Project
The goal of this project is to demonstrate **secure coding practices** and the role of **input validation** in cybersecurity.  
By building this tool, I aimed to showcase:
- Practical application of **Python and Tkinter** for security-focused software.
- Use of **regular expressions** for enforcing security rules.
- How **usability and security** can be combined in one solution.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**
- **Tkinter** (GUI)
- **Regular Expressions (re module)**

## üìå How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/password-complexity-checker.git
   cd password-complexity-checker

Conclusion

This project reflects my understanding of both software development and cybersecurity principles.
It can be further extended into enterprise-grade systems like login portals or password managers, making it a relevant and practical project for modern security needs.
